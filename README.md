# Ferris Minesweeper

A Minesweeper built with Rust and GTK 4.

## Roadmap

* Now the game is using a built-in icon to show flag when user hits a square with right mouse button. Change that to show a flag icon.
* When a square blows up, the game shows a built-in icon of a worried face. Change it to use a bomb icon.
* On macOS Control + Click does not simulate right click. Implement it.
* Create a menu bar to allow user starts a new game and select the game level.
* Show a message when the game is over and allow user to starts a new game.
* Add sound effects for user actions.
